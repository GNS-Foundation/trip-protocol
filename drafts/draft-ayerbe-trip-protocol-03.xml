      <t>
        This document specifies the Trajectory-based Recognition of
        Identity Proof (TRIP) protocol, a decentralized mechanism for
        establishing claims of physical-world presence through
        cryptographically signed, spatially quantized location
        attestations called "breadcrumbs." Breadcrumbs are chained into
        an append-only log, bundled into verifiable epochs, and
        distilled into a Trajectory Identity Token (TIT) that serves
        as a persistent pseudonymous identifier.
      </t>
      <t>
        The protocol employs a Criticality Engine grounded in
        statistical physics to distinguish biological movement from
        synthetic trajectories. Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis
        detects the 1/f signature of Self-Organized Criticality in
        human mobility through the PSD scaling exponent alpha. A
        six-component Hamiltonian energy function scores each
        breadcrumb against the identity's learned behavioral profile
        in real time.
      </t>
      <t>
        This revision (-03) addresses three areas identified through
        expert review by researchers in the statistical physics
        community: it replaces informal terminology with standard
        spectral analysis nomenclature; it provides the analytical
        and numerical bridge between the Levy flight displacement
        exponent and the PSD scaling exponent; and it introduces a
        convergence analysis framework for quantifying the minimum
        trajectory length required for reliable single-trajectory
        classification. Additionally, this revision removes Passive
        Verification mode entirely, requiring all Attestation Results
        to be bound to Relying Party nonces via the Active
        Verification Protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
        TRIP is designed to be transport-agnostic and operates
        independently of any particular naming system, blockchain,
        or application layer.

      <t>
        Conventional approaches to proving that an online actor
        corresponds to a physical human being rely on biometric
        capture, government-issued documents, or knowledge-based
        challenges. Each technique introduces a centralized trust
        anchor, creates honeypots of personally identifiable
        information (PII), and is susceptible to replay or deepfake
        attacks.
      </t>
      <t>
        TRIP takes a fundamentally different approach: it treats
        sustained physical movement through the real world as evidence
        of embodied existence. A TRIP-enabled device periodically
        records its position as a "breadcrumb" -- a compact,
        privacy-preserving, cryptographically signed attestation that
        the holder of a specific Ed25519 key pair was present in a
        particular spatial cell at a particular time. An adversary who
        controls only digital infrastructure cannot fabricate a
        plausible trajectory because doing so requires controlling
        radio-frequency environments (GPS, Wi-Fi, cellular, IMU) at
        many geographic locations over extended periods.
      </t>
      <t>
        Version -01 introduced a Criticality Engine grounded in
        Giorgio Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning work on scale-free
        correlations <xref target="PARISI-NOBEL"/> and
        Albert-Laszlo Barabasi's research on the fundamental limits
        of human mobility <xref target="BARABASI-MOBILITY"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Version -02 formalized the mapping to the RATS Architecture
        <xref target="RFC9334"/>, introduced the Active Verification
        Protocol with cryptographic freshness guarantees, and corrected
        the privacy model.
      </t>
      <t>
        This revision (-03) addresses three substantive issues
        identified through expert review by researchers working in
        the statistical physics of complex systems:
      </t>
      <t>
        First, it replaces the informal term "Parisi Factor" with
        the standard spectral analysis term "PSD scaling exponent
        alpha," properly attributing the theoretical foundation to
        Parisi's work without conflating tribute with established
        nomenclature.
      </t>
      <t>
        Second, it provides the missing analytical and numerical
        bridge between the Levy flight displacement exponent beta
        (Section 7.1) and the PSD scaling exponent alpha
        (Section 6.1). Previous revisions asserted both as
        independent properties of human mobility without
        demonstrating their mathematical relationship.
      </t>
      <t>
        Third, it introduces a convergence analysis framework
        (Section 6.3) that addresses the fundamental question of
        applying ensemble statistical properties to single
        trajectories, including guidance on minimum trajectory
        length and error rate estimation.
      </t>
      <t>
        Additionally, this revision removes Passive Verification
        mode entirely. All Attestation Results MUST now be bound
        to Relying Party nonces via the Active Verification
        Protocol (Section 12), eliminating the replay vulnerability
        identified in -02 review.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document specifies the data structures, algorithms,
        and verification procedures that constitute the TRIP
        protocol. It intentionally omits transport bindings,
        naming-system integration, and blockchain anchoring, all
        of which are expected to be addressed in companion
        specifications.

        </t>
        <ul>
          <li>Replaced the term "Parisi Factor" with the standard

          throughout the document. The theoretical contribution of
          Parisi's work is acknowledged in the motivation and
          terminology, not in the variable naming.</li>

          <li>Added Section 6.3 (Levy-PSD Bridge) providing the
          analytical relationship between the Levy flight displacement
          exponent beta and the PSD scaling exponent alpha, with

          and error rate estimation framework.</li>

          <li>Removed Passive Verification mode entirely
          (Section 12). All Attestation Results MUST now be produced
          via the Active Verification Protocol with Relying
          Party-supplied nonces. The PoH Certificate fields for
          nonce (field 12) and chain head hash (field 13) are now
          REQUIRED, not optional.</li>

          <li>Updated the PoH Certificate (Section 9) to reflect
          mandatory Active Verification fields.</li>

          <li>Added references to recent empirical studies on spectral

    <section anchor="criticality-engine" numbered="true" toc="include">
      <name>The Criticality Engine</name>
      <t>
        The Criticality Engine is the core analytical component of the
        TRIP Verifier. It evaluates whether a trajectory exhibits the
        statistical signature of biological Self-Organized Criticality
        (SOC) -- the phenomenon where living systems operate at the
        boundary between order and chaos, producing scale-free
        correlations that are mathematically distinct from synthetic or
        automated movement.
      </t>
      <t>
        The theoretical foundation rests on three pillars:
      </t>
      <t>
        First, Parisi's demonstration <xref target="PARISI-NOBEL"/>
        that flocking organisms such as starling murmurations exhibit
        scale-free correlations <xref target="CAVAGNA-STARLINGS"/>
        where perturbations propagate across the entire group regardless
        of size. Crucially, Ballerini et al. showed that these
        interactions are topological (based on nearest k neighbors)
        rather than metric (based on distance)
        <xref target="BALLERINI-TOPOLOGICAL"/>. TRIP exploits this
        through Power Spectral Density analysis (Section 6.1): human
        movement produces characteristic 1/f pink noise that synthetic
        trajectories cannot replicate.
      </t>
      <t>
        Second, Barabasi et al.'s discovery
        <xref target="BARABASI-MOBILITY"/> that human displacement
        follows truncated Levy flights with approximately 93%
        predictability <xref target="SONG-LIMITS"/>. TRIP learns each
        identity's mobility profile -- displacement distribution,
        anchor transition patterns, and circadian rhythms -- and
        detects deviations from these learned baselines (Section 7).
      </t>
      <t>
        Third, a six-component Hamiltonian energy function (Section 8)
        that combines spatial, temporal, kinetic, flock-alignment,
        contextual, and structural analysis into a single anomaly score
        for each incoming breadcrumb. The Hamiltonian provides real-time
        detection while the PSD and mobility statistics provide
        aggregate trajectory assessment.
      </t>

        <name>Power Spectral Density Analysis</name>
        <t>
          The primary diagnostic is the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of
          the displacement time series. Given a trajectory of N
          breadcrumbs with displacements d(i) between consecutive
          breadcrumbs, the PSD is computed via the Discrete Fourier
          Transform:
        </t>
        <artwork type="ascii-art"><![CDATA[
   S(f) = |DFT(d)|^2

   and d(i) = haversine_distance(cell(i), cell(i-1))
]]></artwork>
        <t>
          The PSD is then fitted to a power-law model:
        </t>
        <artwork type="ascii-art"><![CDATA[
   S(f) ~ 1 / f^alpha
]]></artwork>
        <t>
          The exponent alpha is the PSD scaling exponent -- referred to
          in the spectral analysis literature as the "spectral exponent"
          or "scaling exponent." In the context of human mobility, this
          quantity captures the degree of long-range temporal correlation
          in movement patterns. The theoretical significance of this
          exponent derives from Parisi's work demonstrating that
          biological systems operating at criticality produce
          characteristic scale-free correlations
          <xref target="PARISI-NOBEL"/>. The PSD scaling exponent
          is the critical diagnostic:

          A conforming implementation MUST compute the PSD scaling
          exponent over a sliding window of the most recent 64
          breadcrumbs (minimum) to 256 breadcrumbs (recommended).
          The alpha value MUST fall within [0.30, 0.80] for the
          trajectory to be classified as biological.
        </t>
        <t>
          The key insight is that automated movement generators lack
          the long-range temporal correlations ("memory") inherent in
          a system operating at criticality. A random walk produces
          white noise (alpha near 0). A deterministic replay produces
          brown noise (alpha near 2). Only a biological system
          operating at the critical point produces pink noise in the
          characteristic [0.30, 0.80] range.
        </t>
        <t>
          NOTE: The alpha range [0.30, 0.80] is a protocol-specified
          classification boundary constructed from combined literature.
          The boundaries are informed by empirical studies demonstrating
          1/f-like spectral properties in human GPS trajectories
          <xref target="VADAI-GPS"/> and general spectral
          characteristics of human physical activity
          <xref target="MACZAK-SPECTRAL"/>. Deployments MAY adjust
          these boundaries based on population-specific calibration
          data, provided that the biological range remains centered
          near alpha = 0.55 and excludes the white noise (alpha &lt;
          0.15) and brown noise (alpha > 1.20) regions.

          This section establishes the mathematical relationship
          between the truncated Levy flight displacement exponent beta
          (Section 7.1) and the PSD scaling exponent alpha
          (Section 6.1). Previous revisions of this specification
          asserted both as independent properties of human mobility.
          This section demonstrates that they are related through the
          spectral properties of heavy-tailed random processes.
        </t>

        <section anchor="analytical-relationship" numbered="true" toc="include">

            For a stationary stochastic process with displacement
            increments drawn from a symmetric stable distribution with
            stability index mu (where mu = beta - 1 for the Levy
            flight exponent beta used in Section 7.1), the Power

          <t>
            However, human displacement follows TRUNCATED Levy flights
            with an exponential cutoff at distance kappa
            (Section 7.1). The truncation modifies the spectral
            relationship: at low frequencies (long time scales), the
            exponential cutoff causes the process to resemble
            Brownian motion (alpha approaching 2), while at high
            frequencies (short time scales), the pure Levy scaling
            dominates. For the intermediate frequency range relevant
            to TRIP's sliding window (64-256 breadcrumbs collected
            at 15-minute intervals, spanning approximately 16-64
            hours of movement data), the effective PSD scaling
            exponent is:
          </t>
          <artwork type="ascii-art"><![CDATA[
   alpha_eff ~ (3 - beta) * g(N, kappa, delta_t)

     g(...)  = correction factor for truncation and finite window
     N       = number of breadcrumbs in the analysis window
     kappa   = truncation distance (km)
     delta_t = mean inter-breadcrumb interval

   For typical human values:
     beta  ~ 1.75  =>  3 - beta = 1.25
     g(...)  ~ 0.4 - 0.6  (empirically observed)

        <t>
          The exponent beta captures the heavy-tailed nature of human

          H3-quantized Evidence is transmitted from the Attester to
          the Verifier. This is an explicit design choice: the Verifier
          requires access to the full breadcrumb chain to compute PSD
          scaling exponents, fit Levy flight parameters, and evaluate
          the Hamiltonian.

        <t>
          Privacy preservation derives from the H3 quantization
          transform applied by the Attester before any data leaves the
          device, NOT from data locality. Raw GPS coordinates MUST NOT
          be transmitted. The quantization transform is lossy and
          irreversible.

        TRIP provides replay protection at two distinct layers:
        protection of the Evidence chain against tampering, and
        protection of Attestation Results against replay to Relying

          Hamiltonian is self-calibrating per identity. For stationary
          users, implementations SHOULD supplement spatial PSD with
          temporal PSD (analyzing inter-breadcrumb timing patterns).
          Deployments MUST NOT impose minimum spatial diversity
          requirements that would exclude users with mobility
          limitations.

      <t>
        The TRIP protocol builds upon foundational work in cryptographic
        identity systems, geospatial indexing, statistical physics, and
        network science. The author thanks the contributors to the H3
        geospatial system, the Ed25519 specification authors, and the
        broader IETF community for establishing the standards that TRIP
        builds upon. The Criticality Engine framework is inspired by the
        work of Giorgio Parisi on scale-free correlations in biological
        systems and Albert-Laszlo Barabasi on the fundamental limits of
        human mobility.
      </t>
      <t>
        The author thanks Muhammad Usama Sardar (TU Dresden) for
        detailed review of -01 and -02 that identified the need for
        explicit RATS role mapping, attestation-result replay
        protection, privacy model corrections, and the removal of
        Passive Verification mode. Sardar's contributions substantially
        improved the rigor of this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        The author thanks Jun Zhang for raising critical questions about
        accessibility and the applicability of mobility models to users
        with limited physical mobility, leading to the Accessibility and
        Low-Mobility Users section.
      </t>
      <t>
        The author thanks an anonymous reviewer from the statistical
        physics community for identifying three critical issues addressed
        in this revision: the need for standard spectral analysis
        terminology, the missing analytical bridge between Levy flight
        parameters and PSD scaling exponents, and the fundamental
        question of applying ensemble properties to single trajectories.
        These contributions led to Sections 6.3 and 6.4 and the new
        Section 13.7 on statistical classifier limitations.
