          TRIP: Trajectory-based Recognition of Identity Proof
                     draft-ayerbe-trip-protocol-02

Abstract

   This document specifies the Trajectory-based Recognition of Identity
   Proof (TRIP) protocol, a decentralized mechanism for establishing
   claims of physical-world presence through cryptographically signed,
   spatially quantized location attestations called "breadcrumbs."
   Breadcrumbs are chained into an append-only log, bundled into
   verifiable epochs, and distilled into a Trajectory Identity Token
   (TIT) that serves as a persistent pseudonymous identifier.

   The protocol employs a Criticality Engine grounded in statistical
   physics to distinguish biological movement from synthetic
   trajectories.  Power Spectral Density analysis detects the 1/f
   signature of Self-Organized Criticality in human mobility.  A six-
   component Hamiltonian energy function scores each breadcrumb against
   the identity's learned behavioral profile in real time.

   This revision formalizes the mapping to the RATS Architecture (RFC
   9334), clarifies the Verifier trust model including support for
   multiple independent Verifiers, introduces an active challenge-
   response verification protocol that binds Attestation Results to
   specific Relying Party requests with cryptographic freshness, and
   corrects the privacy model to accurately describe the flow of
   Evidence between Attester and Verifier.

   TRIP is designed to be transport-agnostic and operates independently
   of any particular naming system, blockchain, or application layer.

1.  Introduction

   Conventional approaches to proving that an online actor corresponds
   to a physical human being rely on biometric capture, government-
   issued documents, or knowledge-based challenges.  Each technique
   introduces a centralized trust anchor, creates honeypots of
   personally identifiable information (PII), and is susceptible to
   replay or deepfake attacks.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


   TRIP takes a fundamentally different approach: it treats sustained
   physical movement through the real world as evidence of embodied
   existence.  A TRIP-enabled device periodically records its position
   as a "breadcrumb" -- a compact, privacy- preserving,
   cryptographically signed attestation that the holder of a specific
   Ed25519 key pair was present in a particular spatial cell at a
   particular time.  An adversary who controls only digital
   infrastructure cannot fabricate a plausible trajectory because doing
   so requires controlling radio-frequency environments (GPS, Wi-Fi,
   cellular, IMU) at many geographic locations over extended periods.

   Version -01 introduced a Criticality Engine grounded in Giorgio
   Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning work on scale-free correlations
   [PARISI-NOBEL] and Albert-Laszlo Barabasi's research on the
   fundamental limits of human mobility [BARABASI-MOBILITY].

   This revision (-02) addresses three areas identified through expert
   review: it formalizes the mapping between TRIP components and the
   RATS Architecture [RFC9334], explicitly stating the Verifier trust
   model and multi-Verifier deployment assumptions; it introduces an
   active challenge-response verification protocol that provides
   cryptographic freshness guarantees for Attestation Results; and it
   corrects the privacy model to accurately describe that H3-quantized
   Evidence is transmitted to the Verifier, with privacy deriving from
   the lossy quantization transform rather than data locality.

   This document specifies the data structures, algorithms, and
   verification procedures that constitute the TRIP protocol.  It
   intentionally omits transport bindings, naming-system integration,
   and blockchain anchoring, all of which are expected to be addressed
   in companion specifications.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   Terms defined in the RATS Architecture [RFC9334] (Attester, Evidence,
   Verifier, Attestation Result, Relying Party) are used throughout this
   document with their RFC 9334 meanings.  Additional terms specific to
   TRIP:

   Breadcrumb  A single, signed attestation of spatiotemporal presence.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


      The atomic unit of TRIP Evidence.

   Trajectory  An ordered, append-only chain of breadcrumbs produced by
      a single identity key pair.

   Epoch  A bundle of breadcrumbs (default 100) sealed with a Merkle
      root, forming a verifiable checkpoint.

   Trajectory Identity Token (TIT)  A pseudonymous identifier derived
      from an Ed25519 public key paired with trajectory metadata.

   Criticality Engine  The analytical subsystem that evaluates
      trajectory statistics for signs of biological Self-Organized
      Criticality (SOC).  In RATS terms, the Criticality Engine is a
      component of the Verifier.

   Hamiltonian (H)  A weighted energy function that quantifies how much
      a new breadcrumb deviates from the identity's learned behavioral
      profile.

   Anchor Cell  An H3 cell where an identity has historically spent
      significant time (e.g., home, workplace).

   Flock  The set of co-located TRIP entities whose aggregate movement
      provides a reference signal for alignment verification.

   Proof-of-Humanity (PoH) Certificate  A compact Attestation Result
      containing only statistical exponents derived from the trajectory,
      with no raw location data.

1.3.  Changes from -01

   This section summarizes the substantive changes from draft-ayerbe-
   trip-protocol-01:

   *  Expanded the RATS Architecture mapping (Section 11) with explicit
      Verifier trust model, multi-Verifier deployment language, and
      Evidence flow description.

   *  Replaced the two-sentence replay protection text with a full
      section (Section 12) covering chain-level replay, attestation-
      result replay, and the Active Verification Protocol with CDDL
      schemas.

   *  Corrected the privacy model (Section 14) to state that
      H3-quantized Evidence is transmitted to the Verifier; privacy
      derives from the quantization transform, not data locality.

   *  Added Deployment Considerations (Section 15) addressing multi-
      Verifier operation, trust delegation, and federation.

   *  Moved RFC 9334 from informative to normative references.

2.  Breadcrumb Data Structure

   A breadcrumb is encoded as a CBOR map [RFC8949] with the following
   fields:

        +=====+==================+===============================+
        | Key | CBOR Type        | Description                   |
        +=====+==================+===============================+
        | 0   | uint             | Index (sequence number)       |

        +-----+------------------+-------------------------------+
        | 3   | uint             | H3 cell index                 |

2.1.  Spatial Quantization

   The H3 geospatial indexing system [H3] partitions the Earth's surface
   into hexagonal cells at multiple resolutions.  TRIP employs
   resolutions 7 through 10:

     +------------+-------------+-------------+----------------------+

                     Table 2: H3 Resolution Parameters

   A conforming implementation MUST quantize raw GPS coordinates to an
   H3 cell before any signing or storage operation.  Raw coordinates
   MUST NOT appear in breadcrumbs or in any protocol message transmitted
   between TRIP entities.

   H3 resolution is a configurable protocol parameter.  Implementations
   SHOULD default to resolution 10.  Deployments MAY select alternative
   resolutions based on jurisdictional requirements, population density,
   and use-case sensitivity.  Lower resolutions (larger cells) provide
   stronger location privacy at the cost of reduced spatial
   discrimination for trust computation.

2.2.  Context Digest Computation

   The context digest binds ambient environmental signals to the
   breadcrumb without revealing them.  The digest is computed as
   follows:

   1.  Construct a pipe-delimited string of tagged components in the
       following order:

       *  "h3:" followed by the H3 cell hex string

       *  "ts:" followed by the timestamp bucketed to 5-minute intervals
          (floor(Unix_minutes / 5) * 5)

       *  "wifi:" followed by the first 16 hex characters of SHA-
          256(sorted comma-joined BSSIDs), if Wi-Fi scan data is
          available

       *  "cell:" followed by the first 16 hex characters of SHA-
          256(sorted comma-joined tower IDs), if cellular data is
          available

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


       *  "imu:" followed by the first 16 hex characters of SHA-256(IMU
          vector string), if inertial sensor data is available

   2.  Compute SHA-256 over the UTF-8 encoding of the resulting string.

   Absent components MUST be omitted entirely, not represented as empty
   strings.

2.3.  Signature Production

   The signable payload is the deterministic CBOR encoding (per
   Section 4.2 of [RFC8949]) of a CBOR map containing fields 0 through
   7, with map keys sorted in ascending integer order.  The Ed25519
   signature [RFC8032] is computed over the raw bytes of this CBOR
   encoding and stored at key 8.

      signable_payload = CBOR-Deterministic(fields[0..7])
      signature        = Ed25519-Sign(private_key, signable_payload)

   Deterministic CBOR encoding ensures that any conforming
   implementation produces identical byte sequences for the same logical
   content, which is essential for reproducible signature verification
   across heterogeneous platforms.

2.4.  Block Hash and Chaining

   The block hash is the SHA-256 digest of the complete deterministic
   CBOR encoding of the breadcrumb (fields 0 through 8 inclusive, i.e.,
   including the signature):

      BreadcrumbHash(B) = SHA-256(CBOR-Deterministic(B[0..8]))
      B[N+1].field[6]   = BreadcrumbHash(B[N])
      B[0].field[6]     = null

   Each breadcrumb at index > 0 MUST carry the block hash of its
   immediate predecessor in field 6, forming an append-only hash chain.
   The genesis breadcrumb (index 0) MUST set field 6 to null (CBOR
   simple value 22).

3.  Chain Management

3.1.  Location Deduplication

   Proof-of-Trajectory requires demonstrated movement.  A conforming
   implementation MUST reject a breadcrumb if the H3 cell is identical
   to the immediately preceding breadcrumb.  Implementations SHOULD also
   enforce a cap (default 10) on the number of breadcrumbs recordable at
   any single H3 cell to prevent stationary farming.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


3.2.  Minimum Collection Interval

   Breadcrumbs SHOULD be collected at intervals of no less than 15
   minutes.  An implementation MAY allow shorter intervals during
   explicit "exploration" sessions but MUST NOT accept intervals shorter
   than 5 minutes.

3.3.  Chain Verification

   A Verifier MUST check:

   1.  Index values form a contiguous sequence starting at 0.

   2.  Timestamps are monotonically non-decreasing.

   3.  Each previousHash matches the block hash of the prior breadcrumb.

   4.  Each Ed25519 signature verifies against the identity public key
       and the canonical signed data.

4.  Epochs

   An epoch seals a batch of breadcrumbs (default 100) under a Merkle
   root.  The epoch record is a CBOR map containing:

          +=====+===========+===================================+
          | Key | Type      | Description                       |
          +=====+===========+===================================+
          | 0   | uint      | Epoch number                      |

   The Merkle tree MUST use SHA-256 and a canonical left-right ordering
   of breadcrumb block hashes.  An epoch is sealed when the breadcrumb
   count reaches the epoch size threshold.

5.  Trajectory Identity Token (TIT)

   A TIT is the externally presentable identity derived from a TRIP
   trajectory.  It consists of:

   *  The Ed25519 public key (32 bytes).

   *  The current epoch count.

   *  The total breadcrumb count.

   *  The count of unique H3 cells visited.

   *  A trust score (see Section 10).

   A TIT SHOULD be encoded as a CBOR map for machine consumption and MAY
   additionally be represented as a Base64url string for URI embedding.

6.  The Criticality Engine

   The Criticality Engine is the core analytical component of the TRIP
   Verifier.  It evaluates whether a trajectory exhibits the statistical
   signature of biological Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) -- the
   phenomenon where living systems operate at the boundary between order
   and chaos, producing scale-free correlations that are mathematically
   distinct from synthetic or automated movement.

   The theoretical foundation rests on three pillars:

   First, Parisi's demonstration [PARISI-NOBEL] that flocking organisms
   such as starling murmurations exhibit scale-free correlations
   [CAVAGNA-STARLINGS] where perturbations propagate across the entire
   group regardless of size.  Crucially, Ballerini et al. showed that
   these interactions are topological (based on nearest k neighbors)
   rather than metric (based on distance) [BALLERINI-TOPOLOGICAL].  TRIP
   exploits this through Power Spectral Density analysis (Section 6.1):
   human movement produces characteristic 1/f pink noise that synthetic
   trajectories cannot replicate.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


   Second, Barabasi et al.'s discovery [BARABASI-MOBILITY] that human
   displacement follows truncated Levy flights with approximately 93%
   predictability [SONG-LIMITS].  TRIP learns each identity's mobility
   profile -- displacement distribution, anchor transition patterns, and
   circadian rhythms -- and detects deviations from these learned
   baselines (Section 7).

   Third, a six-component Hamiltonian energy function (Section 8) that
   combines spatial, temporal, kinetic, flock-alignment, contextual, and
   structural analysis into a single anomaly score for each incoming
   breadcrumb.  The Hamiltonian provides real-time detection while the
   PSD and mobility statistics provide aggregate trajectory assessment.

6.1.  Power Spectral Density Analysis

   The primary diagnostic is the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the
   displacement time series.  Given a trajectory of N breadcrumbs with
   displacements d(i) between consecutive breadcrumbs, the PSD is
   computed via the Discrete Fourier Transform:

      S(f) = |DFT(d)|^2

      where d = [d(0), d(1), ..., d(N-1)]
      and d(i) = haversine_distance(cell(i), cell(i-1))

   The PSD is then fitted to a power-law model:

      S(f) ~ 1 / f^alpha

   The exponent alpha (the "Parisi Factor") is the critical diagnostic:

                Table 4: PSD Alpha Exponent Classification

   A conforming implementation MUST compute the PSD alpha exponent over
   a sliding window of the most recent 64 breadcrumbs (minimum) to 256
   breadcrumbs (recommended).  The alpha value MUST fall within [0.30,
   0.80] for the trajectory to be classified as biological.

   The key insight is that automated movement generators lack the long-
   range temporal correlations ("memory") inherent in a system operating
   at criticality.  A random walk produces white noise (alpha near 0).
   A deterministic replay produces brown noise (alpha near 2).  Only a
   biological system operating at the critical point produces pink noise
   in the characteristic [0.30, 0.80] range.

6.2.  Criticality Confidence Score

   The Criticality Confidence is a value in [0, 1] computed from the
   alpha exponent and the goodness-of-fit (R-squared) of the power-law
   regression:

      alpha_score = 1.0 - |alpha - 0.55| / 0.25

      criticality_confidence = alpha_score * R_squared

      where:
        0.55 is the center of the biological range
        0.25 is the half-width of the biological range
        R_squared is the coefficient of determination of the
          log-log linear regression

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


   A criticality_confidence below 0.5 SHOULD trigger elevated
   monitoring.  A value below 0.3 SHOULD flag the trajectory for manual
   review or additional verification challenges.

7.  Mobility Statistics

   This section defines the mobility model that enforces known
   constraints of human movement, as established by Barabasi et al.
   [BARABASI-MOBILITY].

7.1.  Truncated Levy Flights

   Human displacement between consecutive recorded locations follows a
   truncated power-law distribution:

      P(delta_r) ~ delta_r^(-beta) * exp(-delta_r / kappa)

      where:
        delta_r = displacement distance (km)
        beta    = power-law exponent (typically 1.50 - 1.90)
        kappa   = exponential cutoff distance (km)

   The exponent beta captures the heavy-tailed nature of human movement:
   most displacements are short (home to office) but occasional long
   jumps (travel) follow a predictable distribution.  The cutoff kappa
   is learned per identity and represents the characteristic maximum
   range.

   A conforming implementation MUST maintain a running estimate of beta
   and kappa for each identity by fitting the displacement histogram
   using maximum likelihood estimation over the most recent epoch (100
   breadcrumbs).

   A new displacement that falls outside the 99.9th percentile of the
   fitted distribution MUST increment the spatial anomaly counter.

7.2.  Trajectory Predictability

   Research has demonstrated that approximately 93% of human movement is
   predictable based on historical patterns [SONG-LIMITS].  TRIP
   exploits this by maintaining a Markov Transition Matrix over anchor
   cells:

      T[a_i][a_j] = count(transitions from a_i to a_j)
                     / count(all departures from a_i)

      where a_i, a_j are anchor cells.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


   An anchor cell is defined as any H3 cell where the identity has
   recorded 5 or more breadcrumbs.  The transition matrix is rebuilt at
   each epoch boundary.

   The predictability score Pi for an identity is the fraction of
   observed transitions that match the highest-probability successor in
   the Markov matrix.  Human identities converge toward Pi values in the
   range [0.80, 0.95] after approximately 200 breadcrumbs.  Deviations
   below 0.60 are anomalous.

7.3.  Circadian and Weekly Profiles

   The implementation SHOULD maintain two histogram profiles:

   *  A circadian profile C[hour] recording the probability of activity
      in each hour of the day (24 bins).

   *  A weekly profile W[day] recording the probability of activity on
      each day of the week (7 bins).

   These profiles provide the temporal baseline for the Hamiltonian
   temporal energy component (Section 8.2).

8.  The Six-Component Hamiltonian

   To assess each incoming breadcrumb, the Criticality Engine computes a
   weighted energy score H that quantifies how much the breadcrumb
   deviates from the identity's learned behavioral profile.  High energy
   indicates anomalous behavior; low energy indicates normalcy.

      H = w_1 * H_spatial
        + w_2 * H_temporal
        + w_3 * H_kinetic
        + w_4 * H_flock
        + w_5 * H_contextual
        + w_6 * H_structure

   Default weights:

    +--------------+--------+----------------------------------------+

                  Table 5: Hamiltonian Component Weights

   Weights are modulated by the profile maturity m, defined as
   min(breadcrumb_count / 200, 1.0).  During the bootstrap phase (m <
   1.0), all weights are scaled by m, widening the acceptance threshold
   for new identities.

8.1.  H_spatial: Displacement Anomaly

   Given the identity's fitted truncated Levy distribution P(delta_r),
   the spatial energy for a displacement delta_r is the negative log-
   likelihood (surprise):

      H_spatial = -log(P(delta_r))

      where P(delta_r) = C * delta_r^(-beta) * exp(-delta_r / kappa)
      and C is the normalization constant.

   Typical displacements yield H_spatial near the identity's historical
   baseline.  A displacement that exceeds the identity's learned kappa
   cutoff by more than a factor of 3 produces an H_spatial value in the
   CRITICAL range.

8.2.  H_temporal: Rhythm Anomaly

   Using the circadian profile C[hour] and weekly profile W[day]:

      H_temporal = -log(C[current_hour]) - log(W[current_day])

   Activity at 3:00 AM for an identity with a 9-to-5 circadian profile
   yields high H_temporal.  Activity at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday for the
   same identity yields low H_temporal.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


8.3.  H_kinetic: Transition Anomaly

   Using the Markov Transition Matrix T:

      from_anchor = nearest anchor to previous breadcrumb
      to_anchor   = nearest anchor to current breadcrumb
      H_kinetic   = -log(max(T[from_anchor][to_anchor], epsilon))

      where epsilon = 0.001 (floor to prevent log(0))

   A home-to-office transition at 8:00 AM yields low H_kinetic.  An
   office-to-unknown-city transition yields high H_kinetic.

8.4.  H_flock: Topological Alignment

   Inspired by Parisi's finding that starlings track their k nearest
   topological neighbors (k approximately 6-7) rather than all birds
   within a metric radius [PARISI-NOBEL], the flock energy measures
   alignment between the identity's velocity vector and the aggregate
   velocity of co-located TRIP entities.

      v_self  = displacement vector of current identity
      v_flock = mean displacement vector of k nearest
                co-located identities (k = 7)

      alignment = dot(v_self, v_flock)
                  / (|v_self| * |v_flock|)

      H_flock = 1.0 - max(alignment, 0)

   When flock data is unavailable (sparse network or privacy
   constraints), the implementation SHOULD fall back to comparing the
   current velocity against the identity's own historical velocity
   distribution at the same location and time-of-day.

   H_flock defeats GPS replay attacks: an adversary replaying a
   previously recorded trajectory will find that the ambient flock has
   changed since the recording, producing a misalignment signal.

8.5.  H_contextual: Sensor Cross-Correlation

   This component compares the IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope) signature
   against the claimed GPS displacement.  A genuine device in motion
   produces correlated IMU and GPS readings.  GPS injection on a
   stationary device is detected by the absence of corresponding IMU
   activity:

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


      H_contextual = divergence(
        observed_imu_magnitude,
        expected_imu_magnitude_for(gps_displacement)
      )

   Implementations that lack IMU access MUST set H_contextual = 0 and
   SHOULD increase the weights of other components proportionally.

8.6.  H_structure: Chain Structural Integrity

   This component evaluates the structural properties of the breadcrumb
   chain itself:

   *  Inter-breadcrumb timing regularity: excessively uniform intervals
      suggest automation.

   *  Hash chain continuity: any break in the chain produces maximum
      H_structure.

   *  Phase-space smoothness: the velocity-acceleration phase portrait
      of a human trajectory traces smooth loops, while bots produce
      either chaotic blobs or tight limit cycles.

8.7.  Alert Classification

   The total Hamiltonian H maps to an alert level.  The baseline
   H_baseline is the rolling median of the identity's own recent energy
   values, making the threshold self-calibrating per identity:

     +=========================+============+========================+
     | H Range                 | Level      | Action                 |

   (in the RATS sense) asserting that an identity has demonstrated
   biological movement characteristics.  It contains ONLY statistical

   coordinates, no cell identifiers.

   Fields 12 and 13 are populated only when the certificate is issued in
   response to an Active Verification request (Section 12.3).  In
   Passive mode, these fields MUST be null.

   A Relying Party receiving a PoH Certificate can verify:

   1.  The Verifier signature (field 14) is valid against a trusted
       Verifier public key.

   2.  The alpha exponent (field 3) falls within [0.30, 0.80].

   3.  The criticality confidence (field 7) exceeds the Relying Party's
       policy threshold.

   4.  The trust score (field 8) meets application requirements.

   5.  The certificate has not expired (field 1 + field 11 > current
       time).

   6.  If Active mode: the nonce (field 12) matches the Relying Party's
       original challenge, and the chain head hash (field 13) provides
       freshness binding.

   The certificate reveals NOTHING about where the identity has been --
   only that it has moved through the world in a manner statistically
   consistent with a biological organism.

10.  Trust Scoring

   The trust score T is computed as a weighted combination of four
   factors:

      T = 0.40 * min(breadcrumb_count / 200, 1.0)
        + 0.30 * min(unique_cells / 50, 1.0)
        + 0.20 * min(days_since_first / 365, 1.0)
        + 0.10 * chain_integrity

      chain_integrity = 1.0 if chain verification passes, else 0.0
      T is expressed as a percentage in [0, 100].

   The threshold for claiming a handle (binding a human-readable name to
   a TIT) requires breadcrumb_count >= 100 and T >= 20.

   In the Parisi percolation model, the trust score also incorporates
   the criticality confidence from the PSD analysis.  A trajectory that
   fails the criticality test (alpha outside [0.30, 0.80]) MUST have its

11.  RATS Architecture Mapping

   TRIP implements the Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture
   defined in [RFC9334].  This section provides the normative mapping
   between TRIP components and RATS roles.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


11.2.  Evidence Flow

   H3-quantized Evidence is transmitted from the Attester to the
   Verifier.  This is an explicit design choice: the Verifier requires
   access to the full breadcrumb chain to compute PSD exponents, fit
   Levy flight parameters, and evaluate the Hamiltonian.

   Privacy preservation derives from the H3 quantization transform
   applied by the Attester before any data leaves the device, NOT from
   data locality.  Raw GPS coordinates MUST NOT be transmitted.  The
   quantization transform is lossy and irreversible: given an H3 cell
   identifier, an observer can determine only that the Attester was
   within the cell's area, not the precise coordinates.

   The Verifier receives cell identifiers, timestamps, context digests,
   and chain hashes.  The Verifier MUST NOT forward raw Evidence to
   Relying Parties.  Only the Attestation Result (PoH Certificate) is
   disclosed to Relying Parties.

11.3.  Verifier Trust Model

   The Relying Party MUST trust the Verifier that produced the
   Attestation Result.  This trust relationship is analogous to the
   trust a TLS client places in a Certificate Authority: the protocol
   defines the verification procedures, but the selection of trusted
   Verifiers is a deployment policy decision.

   The TRIP protocol supports multiple independent Verifiers.  An
   Attester MAY submit Evidence to more than one Verifier.  A Relying
   Party MAY accept Attestation Results from any Verifier it trusts.
   The set of trusted Verifiers is configured by the Relying Party and
   is outside the scope of this specification.

   Each Verifier MUST have its own Ed25519 key pair.  The Verifier signs
   PoH Certificates with its private key (field 14 of the PoH
   Certificate).  Relying Parties verify this signature against the
   Verifier's published public key.

12.  Replay Protection

   TRIP provides replay protection at two distinct layers: protection of
   the Evidence chain against tampering, and protection of Attestation
   Results against replay to Relying Parties.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


12.1.  Chain-Level Replay Protection

   The monotonically increasing index and the chaining via the previous
   block hash field provide replay protection within a single
   trajectory.  A replayed breadcrumb will fail the chain integrity
   check.  Cross-trajectory replay (injecting breadcrumbs signed by
   identity A into a chain belonging to identity B) will fail Ed25519
   signature verification.

   An attacker who obtains a copy of Evidence previously submitted to a
   Verifier cannot inject it into a different identity's chain because
   every breadcrumb is signed by the identity's private key and chained
   to the preceding breadcrumb via hash linkage.

12.2.  Attestation Result Replay Protection

   Chain-level protection ensures Evidence integrity but does not
   prevent an attacker from replaying a previously issued PoH
   Certificate to a Relying Party.  An attacker who intercepts a valid
   PoH Certificate could present it to a different Relying Party, or
   present it after the identity's trust state has changed.

   TRIP defines two verification modes to address this:

   Passive Verification  The Relying Party queries the Verifier for the
      current PoH Certificate associated with an identity.  The Verifier
      returns its most recently computed Attestation Result.  No
      freshness binding is provided.  The Relying Party accepts the
      staleness risk inherent in cached results.  This mode is suitable
      for low-stakes decisions where the cost of a replayed certificate
      is bounded (e.g., read access, rate limiting).

   Active Verification  The Relying Party provides an unpredictable
      nonce to the Verifier as part of a challenge-response exchange.
      The resulting PoH Certificate is cryptographically bound to the
      specific request, the current trajectory state, and the current
      moment.  This mode is REQUIRED for high-stakes decisions (e.g.,
      financial operations, handle claiming, publishing).  See
      Section 12.3 for the full protocol.

12.3.  Active Verification Protocol

   The Active Verification Protocol provides cryptographic freshness
   guarantees by binding the Attestation Result to a Relying Party-
   supplied nonce, the current chain head, and the current time.  The
   protocol proceeds as follows:

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


   1.  The Relying Party generates an unpredictable nonce (RECOMMENDED:
       16 bytes from a cryptographically secure random number generator)
       and sends a Verification Request to the Verifier:

         VerificationRequest = {
           0 => bstr .size 32,   ; identity public key
           1 => bstr .size 16,   ; nonce
           2 => uint,            ; request timestamp
           3 => uint,            ; requested freshness window (seconds)
         }

   2.  The Verifier delivers a Liveness Challenge to the Attester via a
       real-time channel (e.g., WebSocket push, push notification):

         LivenessChallenge = {
           0 => bstr .size 16,   ; nonce (from Relying Party)
           1 => bstr .size 32,   ; verifier identity (public key)
           2 => uint,            ; challenge timestamp
           3 => uint,            ; response deadline (seconds)
         }

   3.  The Attester constructs and signs a Liveness Response binding the
       nonce to the current chain state:

         LivenessResponse = {
           0 => bstr .size 16,   ; nonce echo
           1 => bstr .size 32,   ; chain_head_hash (hash of most
                                 ;   recent breadcrumb)
           2 => uint,            ; response timestamp
           3 => uint,            ; current breadcrumb index
           4 => bstr .size 64,   ; Ed25519 signature over fields 0-3
                                 ;   using identity private key
         }

   4.  The Verifier validates the Liveness Response by checking all of
       the following:

       *  The Ed25519 signature (field 4) is valid against the
          identity's public key over fields 0-3.

       *  The nonce echo (field 0) matches the nonce from the original
          Verification Request.

       *  The chain_head_hash (field 1) is consistent with the
          Verifier's stored trajectory state for this identity.

       *  The response timestamp (field 2) is within the response
          deadline specified in the Liveness Challenge.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


       *  The breadcrumb index (field 3) matches or exceeds the
          Verifier's last known index for this identity.

   5.  Upon successful validation, the Verifier produces a fresh PoH
       Certificate with field 12 set to the Relying Party's nonce and
       field 13 set to the chain_head_hash from the Liveness Response.
       The Verifier signs this certificate with its own Ed25519 key and
       returns it to the Relying Party.

   6.  The Relying Party verifies the PoH Certificate per Section 9,
       additionally confirming that field 12 matches its original nonce.

   If the Attester does not respond within the response deadline, the
   Verifier MUST return an error to the Relying Party indicating that
   liveness could not be confirmed.  The Verifier MUST NOT fall back to
   Passive mode when Active mode was explicitly requested.

13.  Security Considerations

13.1.  GPS Replay Attacks

   An adversary records a legitimate trajectory and replays the GPS
   coordinates on a different device.  TRIP detects this through
   multiple channels:

   *  H_flock: the ambient flock of co-located entities has changed
      since the recording.  The replayed trajectory will show
      misalignment with current human flow.

   *  H_contextual: unless the adversary also replays Wi-Fi BSSIDs,
      cellular tower IDs, and IMU data, the context digest will not
      match.

   *  H_structure: the timing regularity of a replay is typically either
      too perfect (exact timestamps) or shifted in a detectable pattern.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


13.2.  Synthetic Walk Generators

   An adversary uses software to generate plausible-looking GPS
   coordinates.  The Criticality Engine defeats this:

   *  PSD alpha test: random walk generators produce white noise (alpha
      approximately 0).  Brownian motion generators produce alpha
      approximately 2.  Neither falls in the biological [0.30, 0.80]
      range.

   *  Levy flight fitting: synthetic displacements rarely match the
      truncated power-law distribution with biologically plausible beta
      and kappa values.

   *  Predictability test: synthetic trajectories either show near-zero
      predictability (random) or near-perfect predictability (scripted),
      both outside the human [0.80, 0.95] range.

13.3.  Emulator Injection

   An adversary runs the TRIP client on an Android/iOS emulator with
   spoofed GPS.  Detection relies on:

   *  H_contextual: emulators typically provide zero or synthetic IMU
      data that does not correlate with claimed GPS displacement.

   *  Context digest: emulators lack real Wi-Fi scan data and cellular
      tower IDs, producing empty or static context digests.

13.4.  Device Strapping (Robot Dog Attack)

   An adversary straps a phone to a mobile robot or drone.  This is the
   most sophisticated attack because it produces real GPS, Wi-Fi,
   cellular, and IMU data from actual physical movement.  Mitigation
   relies on:

   *  PSD alpha test: robotic movement typically lacks the
      characteristic 1/f noise of biological systems.  Robots move with
      mechanical regularity (brown noise) or programmatic randomness
      (white noise).

   *  Phase-space smoothness (H_structure): a robot's velocity-
      acceleration phase portrait differs characteristically from human
      movement.

   *  Circadian and weekly profiles: a robot generating breadcrumbs 24/7
      will diverge from human activity patterns.




Ayerbe Posada            Expires 13 August 2026                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


   This attack remains an active area of research.  The protocol's
   defense-in-depth approach through multiple independent Hamiltonian
   components makes it progressively more expensive to defeat all
   channels simultaneously.

13.5.  Verifier Compromise

   A compromised Verifier could issue fraudulent PoH Certificates.
   Mitigations include:

   *  Relying Parties SHOULD accept certificates from multiple
      independent Verifiers and cross-check results for high-stakes
      operations.

   *  Verifier key rotation and revocation procedures SHOULD be
      established as part of deployment policy.

   *  The Active Verification Protocol ensures that even a compromised
      Verifier cannot produce a valid certificate without the Attester's
      cooperation (the Liveness Response requires the identity's private
      key).

13.6.  Denial of Service

   An attacker can generate large numbers of Verification Requests or
   breadcrumb submissions to consume Verifier resources.  Verifiers
   SHOULD rate-limit requests per identity and per Relying Party.  The
   Active Verification Protocol's real-time requirement (Attester must
   respond within the deadline) provides an inherent rate limit on valid
   completions.

14.  Privacy Considerations

14.1.  Quantization-Based Privacy

   TRIP's privacy model is based on lossy spatial quantization, not on
   data locality.  H3-quantized Evidence (cell identifiers, timestamps,
   context digests, and chain hashes) is transmitted from the Attester
   to the Verifier.  Raw GPS coordinates MUST NOT be transmitted and
   MUST NOT be stored by the Attester after quantization.

   The H3 quantization transform is lossy and irreversible.  Given an H3
   cell identifier, an observer learns only that the Attester was within
   the cell's area at the stated time.  At the default resolution 10,
   each cell covers approximately 15,000 m^2 (~0.015 km^2), providing
   meaningful ambiguity in populated areas.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


   H3 resolution is a configurable protocol parameter that controls the
   privacy-precision tradeoff.  Deployments operating under strict
   privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) MAY mandate lower resolutions.
   Users SHOULD be informed of the selected resolution and its privacy
   implications.

14.2.  Verifier Data Handling

   The Verifier receives and processes H3-quantized Evidence to compute
   trust scores and PoH Certificates.  The Verifier:

   *  MUST NOT forward raw Evidence (breadcrumbs, cell identifiers,
      timestamps) to Relying Parties.

   *  MUST disclose its data retention policy to Attesters.

   *  SHOULD retain only the statistical aggregates (alpha, beta, kappa,
      transition matrices, circadian profiles) necessary for ongoing
      trust computation, and MAY discard individual breadcrumbs after
      incorporation into the aggregate model.

   *  MUST support data deletion requests where required by applicable
      law.

14.3.  Relying Party Data Minimization

   The PoH Certificate is designed for maximum data minimization.  A
   Relying Party learns:

   *  The identity's public key.

   *  Statistical exponents characterizing movement patterns (alpha,
      beta, kappa).

   *  Aggregate counts (epochs, breadcrumbs, unique cells).

   *  A trust score and criticality confidence.

   A Relying Party does NOT learn: which cities, countries, or specific
   locations the identity has visited; the identity's home or workplace
   locations; the identity's daily schedule; or any raw trajectory data.

14.4.  Trajectory Correlation and Sybil Resistance

   A trajectory is intrinsically linkable: all breadcrumbs share the
   same identity key.  This is by design, as trust accumulation requires
   identity continuity, and Proof-of-Humanity requires a durable binding
   between one physical entity and one cryptographic identity.

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


   A single physical entity operating multiple TRIP identities
   simultaneously constitutes a Sybil attack.  TRIP raises the cost of
   such attacks through multiple mechanisms: each identity requires a
   separate physical device, weeks of sustained movement, and
   independent trajectory accumulation.  The H_flock component
   (Section 8.4) provides a detection mechanism: co-located trajectories
   with identical displacement vectors produce a correlated-movement
   signal that Verifiers MAY use to flag suspected Sybil identities.

   Cross-trajectory correlation analysis (detecting that two identities
   may be operated by the same physical entity) is a Verifier-side
   heuristic and is outside the scope of this specification.  However,
   Verifiers SHOULD implement such heuristics and MAY reduce trust
   scores for trajectories that exhibit sustained co-movement with other
   identities.

14.5.  Population Density Considerations

   In sparsely populated areas, even cell-level granularity may narrow
   identification to very few individuals.  Implementations SHOULD use
   lower resolution (larger cells) in rural areas and MAY allow users to
   override to a lower resolution at any time.

15.  Deployment Considerations

15.1.  Multiple Verifier Deployments

   The TRIP architecture supports multiple independent Verifier
   deployments.  Any entity that implements the verification procedures
   defined in this specification (chain verification, PSD analysis, Levy
   flight fitting, Hamiltonian evaluation) MAY operate as a TRIP
   Verifier.

   An Attester MAY submit Evidence to more than one Verifier
   simultaneously or sequentially.  Each Verifier maintains its own
   independent view of the trajectory and produces its own Attestation
   Results.

   A Relying Party MAY accept Attestation Results from any Verifier it
   trusts.  The mechanism for establishing and managing Verifier trust
   (e.g., trust lists, certificate pinning, reputation systems) is a
   deployment policy decision outside the scope of this specification.

15.2.  Verifier Interoperability

   All conforming Verifiers MUST implement the base verification
   procedures: chain integrity (Section 3.3), PSD alpha classification
   (Section 6.1), and the PoH Certificate format (Section 9).



Ayerbe Posada            Expires 13 August 2026                [Page 29]

Internet-Draft                    TRIP                     February 2026


   Verifiers MAY implement additional analysis beyond the base
   specification (e.g., machine-learning-based anomaly detection,
   additional Hamiltonian components).  Such extensions MUST NOT alter
   the PoH Certificate format but MAY influence the trust score and
   criticality confidence values.

   Two Verifiers processing the same Evidence SHOULD produce consistent
   alpha, beta, and kappa values (within numerical precision bounds)
   because these are derived from deterministic mathematical operations
   on the same input data.  Trust scores MAY differ if Verifiers apply
   different weighting policies.

15.3.  Transport Binding

   This specification does not mandate a specific transport for Evidence
   submission, Liveness Challenges, or Verification Requests.
   Implementations MAY use HTTPS, WebSocket, CoAP, or any transport that
   provides confidentiality and integrity protection.

   The Active Verification Protocol (Section 12.3) requires a real-time
   channel between the Verifier and Attester for Liveness Challenge
   delivery.  Implementations SHOULD use persistent connections (e.g.,
   WebSocket) or mobile push notification services to minimize latency.

15.4.  Naming System Integration

   TRIP operates on Ed25519 public keys and TITs.  The binding of human-
   readable names (handles) to TRIP identities is explicitly outside the
   scope of this specification and is expected to be addressed in a
   companion document.  TRIP provides the trust foundation (PoH
   Certificates) upon which naming systems can make registration and
   access-control decisions.

15.5.  Accessibility and Low-Mobility Users

   TRIP does not require geographic travel.  It requires sustained
   physical existence over time, which is a fundamentally different
   property.  This section clarifies how the protocol accommodates users
   with limited or no physical mobility, addressing concerns raised
   during review [ZHANG-REVIEW].

   A person who remains in a single H3 cell for an extended period still
   generates a valid trajectory.  The trust scoring formula (Section 10)
   assigns 20% weight to temporal continuity (days_since_first) and 40%
   weight to breadcrumb count, both of which accumulate regardless of
   spatial diversity.  A homebound user who collects breadcrumbs over
   365 days achieves 60% of the maximum trust score from time and volume
   alone.

   The context digest (Section 2.2) provides environmental diversity
   even without movement.  Wi-Fi access points in a neighborhood change
   over time as devices are added, removed, or replaced.  Cellular tower
   assignments shift with network load.  IMU sensors detect micro-
   movements (hand tremor, breathing, device repositioning) that produce
   non-trivial context variation.  These ambient changes ensure that
   breadcrumbs collected from a fixed location are not identical,
   defeating simple replay attacks.

   The Hamiltonian (Section 8) is self-calibrating per identity: the
   baseline H_baseline is the rolling median of the identity's own
   energy values.  A user with limited mobility develops a low-energy
   baseline that reflects their actual movement pattern.  Anomalies are
   detected relative to the individual's own profile, not against a
   global expectation of travel.

   The PSD alpha exponent (Section 6.1) may require adaptation for
   stationary users.  When the displacement time series has very low
   variance, the PSD analysis degrades.  Implementations SHOULD
   supplement spatial PSD with temporal PSD (analyzing inter-breadcrumb
   timing patterns) for identities whose unique cell count is below a
   configurable threshold (default: 5 cells over the most recent 200
   breadcrumbs).  Circadian rhythms in collection timing exhibit the
   same 1/f characteristics as spatial displacement, providing an
   alternative criticality signal.

   Deployments MUST NOT impose minimum spatial diversity requirements
   that would exclude users with mobility limitations.  The trust
   scoring formula MAY be adjusted by deployment policy to increase the
   weight of temporal factors for identities that self-declare reduced
   mobility, provided that the overall security model remains sound.

16.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions at this time.  Future revisions may
   request:

   *  CBOR tag assignments for breadcrumb, epoch, PoH Certificate, and
      Active Verification message structures.

   *  A media type registration for application/trip+cbor.

   *  An entry in a TRIP Verification Mode registry (passive, active).

Acknowledgements

   The TRIP protocol builds upon foundational work in cryptographic
   identity systems, geospatial indexing, statistical physics, and
   network science.  The author thanks the contributors to the H3
   geospatial system, the Ed25519 specification authors, and the broader
   IETF community for establishing the standards that TRIP builds upon.
   The Criticality Engine framework is inspired by the work of Giorgio
   Parisi on scale-free correlations in biological systems and Albert-
   Laszlo Barabasi on the fundamental limits of human mobility.

   The author thanks Muhammad Usama Sardar for detailed review of -01
   that identified the need for explicit RATS role mapping, attestation-
   result replay protection, and privacy model corrections.  These
   contributions substantially improved the rigor of this specification.
   The author also thanks Jun Zhang for raising critical questions about
   accessibility and the applicability of mobility models to users with
   limited physical mobility, leading to the Accessibility and Low-
   Mobility Users section.
