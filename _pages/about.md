I am a Colombian-Italian founder with four decades of experience spanning philosophy, journalism, hospitality, and software development.

## Current Work

I lead [ULISSY s.r.l.](https://ulissy.com) in Rome, where I am building the **GNS Protocol** (Geospatial Naming System) — a decentralized identity layer for the Internet that proves humanity through physical movement rather than biometrics or passwords.

The core innovation is **TRIP** (Trajectory-based Recognition of Identity Proof), a protocol that uses Ed25519-signed, spatially quantized location attestations to build cryptographic proof of embodied existence. Drawing on Giorgio Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning work on scale-free correlations in biological systems and Albert-László Barabási's research on the fundamental limits of human mobility, TRIP's Criticality Engine evaluates whether a trajectory exhibits the statistical fingerprint of a living organism operating at the edge of criticality.

TRIP is currently an active [Internet-Draft at the IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ayerbe-trip-protocol/), with alignment to the [RATS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rats/about/) (Remote ATtestation procedureS) working group's attestation architecture (RFC 9334). The protocol specification, reference implementation, and supporting materials are maintained by the [GNS Foundation](https://github.com/GNS-Foundation).

I also designed **ULissy**, a domain-specific programming language for location-aware applications, with spatial primitives, cryptographic signing, and privacy quantization built into the language itself.

## Previous Work

I co-founded [Hotel de la Opera](https://www.hotelopera.com.co/) in Bogotá, Colombia, and later founded **Interactive1 Italia**, a digital agency with offices in London, Milan, and Zagreb specializing in institutional portals, e-learning platforms, and geo-marketing solutions (exited 2016).

## Academic Background

I hold a degree in Philosophy from the **University of Pisa**, where I studied epistemology and evolutionary theory under the late [Remo Bodei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remo_Bodei). My thesis explored the tension between Darwinian competition and Lamarckian cooperation as engines of evolution — a framework that continues to shape everything I build, from the mutualistic design principles behind GNS to my ongoing work on AI ethics and the philosophy of information.

## Research Interests

- Decentralized identity and Proof-of-Trajectory
- Statistical physics applied to human mobility verification
- Domain-specific languages for geospatial applications
- AI ethics, algorithmic aesthetics, and the philosophy of information
- Self-Organized Criticality in biological and digital systems
